# hello-world
Completely new to this idea.
I am a silver haired student, trying to get to grips with basic Arduino use and its modules.
My knowledge is limited, but I an eager to learn.

The Udemy Arduino Step by Step More than 50 Hours Complete Course, I've managed to complete almost half of it.
I am not rushing through the course, and in some cases covering an area more than once.
It is proving to be difficult at times, as the tutor has made assumption about the knowledge level of his students
At times that has left me hanging, looking for additional information to fully understand what is ment.
